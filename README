== BioCatalogue

The BioCatalogue is a Web application that provides registry of Web Services. It
has been originally designed as a registry of biological services but in reality
it is domain-independent and can be used for registering SOAP and REST services
from any domain.

The goals of the BioCatalogue are:

- Provide a single registration point for Web service providers and a single search site for scientists and developers.
- Provide a curated catalogue of life science Web services.
- Providers, expert curators and users can provide oversight, monitor the catalogue and provide high quality annotations for services.
- Provide a place where the community can find, contact and meet the experts and maintainers of these services.

The BioCatalogue was a BBSRC-funded project and has been running since 1st June 2008.
The project was a joint venture between the University of Manchester (led by Carole Goble)
and the EMBL-EBI (led by Rodrigo Lopez).

The service is still running at http://www.biocatalogue.org and is maintained by the
University of Manchester.
